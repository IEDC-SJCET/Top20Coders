### LEADERSHIP AND INFLUENCE

I got an oppertunity to lead a team containing 10 members and we were assigned a task to write a program on air ticketing system. After the successfull completion of the project I recogonised that I have the skill to pursue people and lead them in the right manner. I also promoted my team and the members which helped them to build trust in me which means they will be open to me reflecting their ideas. Being a leader does not mean that being the boss, accrding to my opinion being a leader is equal to being a friend which would give the team members to express their ideas openly.

This will also keep me connected with my interested areas and also helps me to apply my skills in much more precise way.

### OPINION ON INDIAN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND SJCET PALAI

Engineering education in india now demands that we equip ourself with key transferable skills that will enable us to meet the demands of rapidly changing technology and societal expectations of engineers. According to my opinion todays Indian Engineering Education should fill the students with more practical knowledge than theoretical knowledge.
