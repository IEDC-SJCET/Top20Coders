### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

Indian engineering education excels in theory, but could benefit from more hands-on learning and exploration of cutting-edge fields like AI and Web 3.0.  Regular coding contests at SJCET Palai, like those for ISTE chapters, would be a great way to boost practical skills!
