I am applying for this Top 20 opportunity because it aligns perfectly with my professional aspirations and goals. Being recognized as a Top 20 candidate in the field of computer science would validate my dedication to excellence and innovation in this rapidly evolving industry. It would not only showcase my technical skills and expertise but also highlight my commitment to continuous learning and professional development.

This opportunity directly relates to my current profession by providing a platform to showcase my achievements, contributions, and capabilities within the field of computer science. It offers an avenue to connect with other top coders facilitating knowledge exchange, collaboration, and networking opportunities. Additionally, being in the Top 20 would enhance my credibility and visibility within the industry, opening doors to exciting career prospects, partnerships, and projects.

### Career Plan

I aim for a job after the completion of B-tech degree.I'm interested in Front-end web and app development and UI/UX designing jobs, so i would like to work with companies or start-ups having such requirements.But i'm also interested in pure programming based jobs that seeks problem solving skills, programming knowledge and Analytical skills.

### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

As an engineering student,as far as i'm concerned Indian engineering education is shaped by both personal experiences and broader observations within the academic landscape. Indian engineering education is renowned for its rigorous curriculum and emphasis on technical knowledge and skills. The curriculum typically covers a wide range of subjects, from core engineering principles to specialized areas of study, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of their chosen field. Additionally, Indian engineering institutions often foster a culture of academic excellence and competition, which can be both motivating and challenging for students.

However, there are certain areas where Indian engineering education could be improved. One aspect is the need for greater emphasis on practical, hands-on learning experiences. While the theoretical foundation provided by Indian engineering programs is strong, there is sometimes a disconnect between classroom learning and real-world application. Incorporating more opportunities for internships, industry projects, and practical workshops could better prepare students for the demands of the workforce.

As a student of SJCET, i am satisfied with the education system.But it still has may drawbacks as it is a part of the Indian Education System.Some improvements can be done on the practical application of the and hands on experience related to the subjects.More educational support should be provided for the students interested in web deveoplment, App development, UI/UX designing, Artifical intellegence, competitive programming.
