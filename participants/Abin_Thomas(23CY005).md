Indian engineering education, including institutions like SJCET Palai, offers a strong academic foundation but can improve by aligning curriculum with industry needs, emphasizing practical learning experiences, providing faculty development, and fostering innovation and entrepreneurship among students. This can be achieved through updating the curriculum, enhancing lab facilities, promoting industry collaborations, offering faculty training, and supporting student-led initiatives.
