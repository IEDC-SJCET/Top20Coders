## About Me

I am a fullstack web developer with one year of professional experience. I love learning new things in the tech scene and would like to get good at cybersecurity related work sometime. I do art and music on the side, although my main work is always tech related.

### History of Open Source Contributions (optional)

I published a very small [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagecreator) to perform a task for my job. It can embed n strings into an svg file and outputs a png image. I created this package to dynamically create meta images based on different url parameters when visiting a page in my web app.

### Leadership and Influence

I have experience leading small teams at my job, and have one year of experience as a fullstack web developer. I have learned many things from working as a team on the asthra website, tasks for my job and a hackathon. I am always willing to listen to contradicting ideas and allow the team to choose a solution which feels right at the time.

### As a Top 20 Member

Hackathons are a great way to gain skills quickly, and to meet skilled individuals and learn from them. Being part of the Top 20 could be a gateway to furthering my development as an engineer

### Career Plan

I aim to own a successful business by the time I graduate (web dev shop/startup). I will use the experience I gain from my current job and future businesses before I graduate to better my chances of getting a job in a reputed company. I will use my job to save money and further my startup ventures.

### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

There is a lot of wasted time focusing on unrelated subjects like physics and chemistry for a year, which has a negative impact on the development of engineering students. There is also a lack of focus on R&D, which is replaced by focus on the usual academics found in schools. While academics is important, a lack of experience building projects and experimenting with technology leads to dull engineering skills, especially in fast moving fields like computer science.

SJCET Palai has a desire to build a startup culture, but the lack of time to do research does not facilitate such a culture.
If an opportunity to change presents itself, SJCET Palai should focus more on the development of projects and the participation in hackathons can lead to vast improvements in skill levels, which in turn will lead to bigger contributions to society and bigger returns for the college.
