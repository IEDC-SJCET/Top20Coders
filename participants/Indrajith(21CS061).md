## About Me

As a third year BTech student in Computer Science and Engineering, I have a keen interest in technology and love to explore its various aspects. Outside of education, I enjoy travelling, film, music and chess, and find joy and inspiration in these experiences.

Throughout my BTech journey, I got into web development, optimizing tools like React, React Native, Firebase, and Supabase to build comprehensive websites. I also expanded my horizons by participating in Unreal Engine and OBS Studio, and demonstrated my versatility in software development.

My active participation in events like Asthra Tech fest reflects my passion for collaborative projects, where I thrive in team settings and actively contribute to achieving shared goals. I am driven by problem solving, often taking on coding challenges without outside help until needed, a testament to my determination and self-reliance.

Having a strong C programming foundation from my high school days where i also learned C++, I have expanded my skill set to include Python and Java, and have continued to hone my coding skills. My commitment to self-improvement and adaptability to new technologies make me an asset to any project or team I join.

### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

In my opinion, Indian engineering education, including institutions like SJCET Palai, could benefit from a more comprehensive approach that extends beyond traditional academic subjects. While academic excellence is crucial, there's a growing need to allocate additional time and resources for students to explore emerging technologies and practical skills essential for the contemporary job market. Institutions should inspire students to delve into areas like web development, artificial intelligence (AI), and other cutting-edge fields, fostering an environment conducive to innovation and creativity.

Moreover, it's imperative to extend this approach across all engineering branches, including civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering, ensuring that students from diverse backgrounds have exposure to relevant skills and knowledge. By encouraging interdisciplinary learning and collaboration, colleges can equip graduates with a broader skill set and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of various engineering disciplines. Additionally, incorporating more hands-on projects, internships, and industry partnerships can bridge the gap between theory and practice, empowering students to apply their knowledge effectively in real-world scenarios and preparing them for successful careers in the ever-evolving technological landscape.
