### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

Indian engineering education varies in quality across institutions. While some, maintain high standards, others struggle with outdated curriculum and lack of resources. 

While SJCET Palai's quality of factors like faculty expertise and infrastructure are pretty good, 
SJCET Palai prioritizes attendance and excessive class hours over practical skill development, it hinders students ability to excel in their chosen domains, potentially leading to the graduation of less skilled engineers. This emphasis on attendance and class hours reduces opportunities for hands-on learning and practical application of knowledge, which are crucial for developing well-rounded and competent graduates.
