### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

In recent years, concerns have arisen regarding the quality and relevance of engineering programs to meet the demands of the rapidly evolving technology landscape. While many institutions boast world-class faculty and infrastructure, there remains a gap between theoretical knowledge imparted in classrooms and practical skills required in industry. Additionally, the proliferation of engineering colleges has led to issues of oversupply and varying standards of education, raising questions about the overall effectiveness of engineering education in India.
