### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

Indian Engineering Education often features a rigorous curriculum that covers a wide range of subjects and often emphazises a lot on rote learning, rather than creativity and critical thinking. SJCET Palai is a college with a difference that not only offers a strong academic program but also provides a supportive environment where one can thrive personally and professionally.
