### Leadership and Influence

Explain how you meet the requirement for being a leader or influencer in your domain. Provide clear examples of your leadership and influencing skills.

While I have been a leader all my life, this is the first time that I am trying to be a leader in the tech sector. I encourage my classmates to sign up for competitions and workshops that are related to Computer Science. As the Class Representative, I created a Project Exhibition for Asthra this year where we encouraged our classmatess to build projects and showcase their work. As an active member of Mulearn, I also help students who are lost or confused in the Lobby Channel in the Discord Mulearn Server.

While I have not done much, I am certainly excited to do more and bring more people to be industry-oriented.

### As a Top 20 Member

I aspire to be a software developer in the future. That means that it is essential to work on my programming capabilities as well as problem solving skills. Being part of the Top 20 will help me to show that I am capable of solving problems as an engineer. Ultimately, companies are looking for employees who take initiative and work on self growth. Being part of this program and improving my skills that way is one way I hope to do this.

As part of this program, I also hope to meet like-minded individuals who yearn to make a career for themselves and are willing to collaborate on large scale projects. Who knows, maybe we can build the next facebook???

### Career Plan

I am currently considering my options. I would love to build a career for myself in software engineering, however there are also some other fields that I would like to explore. I am looking forward to see what life has in store for me and what sort of life I can create for myself. I am also looking for opportunites for internships and further education.

### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

The college is a good place to study and learn with many good memories and friends. However, I would love to have more industry experiences and opportunites from the college.
