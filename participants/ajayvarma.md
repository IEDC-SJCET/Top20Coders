### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

indian engineering education uses outdated syllabus in a way of basics. in my opinion 1st year should be the place for basics, and we should get the chance to learn about new technologies and learn ourselfs and get the chance to choose our domain/career at 2nd year itself. That way we would be more proficient at the job we choose and that way more chances for getting jobs.
