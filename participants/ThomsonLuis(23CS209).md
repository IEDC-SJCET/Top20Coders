I'm applying as top 20 is because, by doing this I can get more experience and knowledge in this field and getting more social connections with mentors will be a great help for my future. By being in Top 20 not only makes me one of the best coders but rather than I will upskilling eachday and my quality to work on team or project will be improved immensely since, I'm going to work with the best.

Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Pala

My opinion on Indian Engineering Educaiton is really good.But it can be improved thats my opinion. Eventhough our education systems quality is very high but still as time goes the toughness of the exams and the competetion we are facing is really concerning for me. I would say to improve from this, we could use more practical exams rather than theoy ones.
