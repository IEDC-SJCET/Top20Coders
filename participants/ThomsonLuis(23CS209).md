### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

My opinion on Indian Engineering Educaiton is really good.But it can be improved thats my opinion. Eventhough our education systems quality is very high but still as time goes the toughness of the exams and the competetion we are facing is really concerning for me. I would say to improve from this, we could use more practical exams rather than theoy ones.
