## About Me

As a Computer Science and Engineering student, I am deeply passionate about self-development and self-learning. I find immense joy in coding, constantly pushing myself to tackle challenges and learn from my mistakes. With an intermediate foundation in Java and C, I am now venturing into Python, eager to expand my programming horizons. Every coding error is an opportunity for growth, and I relish the process of troubleshooting and problem-solving. My journey is fueled by curiosity, determination, and a relentless pursuit of knowledge. I strive to learn something new with each passing moment, embracing the dynamic world of technology.

### Leadership and Influence

I excel in effective communication, prioritizing clarity and avoiding unnecessary irritants. With extensive experience as an intern and zonal lead at Mulearn, as well as serving as an Execom member of IEDC Sjcet, I've honed my leadership and organizational skills. I've spearheaded numerous events, aiding others in their growth journeys and exposing them to real-world scenarios. My approach is innovative, always thinking outside the box to find creative solutions. I believe in not just conveying information but ensuring it is received positively and leads to meaningful outcomes, fostering a collaborative and productive environment wherever I go.

### As a Top 20 Member

Applying for the Top 20 coders is a deliberate choice driven by my desire to challenge myself among skilled peers, identify areas for improvement, and elevate my coding abilities. This competition represents a significant milestone in my journey toward excellence. I am committed to dissecting my weaknesses, rectifying them diligently, and continuously advancing. Each challenge and interaction will serve as a learning opportunity, propelling me toward greater proficiency and innovation. I embrace this opportunity not just as a competition but as a pivotal step in my quest for continuous growth and mastery in the ever-evolving landscape of programming and technology.


### Career Plan

My immediate goal is to secure a job where I can immerse myself in a professional environment, gaining firsthand experience of workflow dynamics and financial operations. This endeavor is pivotal in shaping my understanding of corporate structures and the intricacies of financial management. With this knowledge as my foundation, I aspire to embark on entrepreneurial ventures or lead projects driven by my own innovative ideas, leveraging the resources and support of established multinational corporations (MNCs). This trajectory will not only enhance my entrepreneurial acumen but also enable me to realize my vision of fostering impactful ventures anchored in both creativity and strategic collaboration.

### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

The Indian engineering education system is perceived as stagnant or slow in its evolution.The current educational syllabus in many engineering institutions is oriented towards skills that were relevant around 15 years ago. Rather than focusing on practical, real-world skills, the system often emphasizes theoretical concepts without real-world applications. This limitation is also observed in institutions like SJCET Palai, which follow similar educational patterns. However, ambitious students with broader aspirations are taking proactive steps to forge their paths to growth. They recognize the importance of self-improvement and are actively seeking opportunities to upskill and acquire relevant competencies beyond the classroom.
