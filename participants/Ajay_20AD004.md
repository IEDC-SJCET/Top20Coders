## About Me

Hailing from Kerala, India, my name is `Ajay T Shaju`, and I'm currently a `B.Tech student` specializing in `AI & DS at SJCET Palai`. As a lifelong learner with a keen interest in `Python programming`, I'm passionate about leveraging it within the realms of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I'm currently focusing on learning about `distributed computing`, aiming to optimize `AI model implementations on multiple CPUs â€” a creative endeavor to make the most of limited resources. My goal is to harness AI and DS to alleviate human efforts in mundane and repetitive tasks`. Beyond academics, I immerse myself in reading a wide range of topics from technology to `biology, economics, and personality development`, reflecting my multifaceted interests.

## Write about yoursel

My journey began in the picturesque state of `Kerala, India`, where I was born and raised. As a B.Tech student at SJCET Palai, I've dedicated myself to not just understanding the core principles of AI & DS but also exploring innovative ways to apply this knowledge practically. Python programming has become my tool of choice(as of now), through which I seek to unlock new possibilities in technology. Currently, my academic pursuits have led me to the field of distributed computing, where I'm learning to implement AI models more efficiently and cost-effectively. This endeavor is driven by `my belief in the power of technology to transform lives`, especially by automating tedious tasks and allowing humans to engage in more creative and fulfilling activities. Outside the classroom, I find solace and inspiration in reading. My interests span technology, biology, economics, and personality development, each adding a layer to my understanding of the world and its intricate workings. Looking ahead, `I am excited about the potential to contribute to meaningful technological advancements that can make a real difference in people's lives`, particularly in developing economies where resources are scarce but aspirations are high.

## History of Open Source Contributions

`Most of my projects are posted on GitHub`, and I try to maintain them whenever possible. These projects are my own, although two of them were done in teams with other people from my college as part of our mini-project and main project works. I have `raised many issues` in different projects and other open-source projects; I've also `tried submitting some pull requests`. As I use Python as my primary programming language, `I utilize many other open-source Python libraries` like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

## History of Community Engagement

Rather than actively engaging with a community, `I often read numerous posts on community forums` when I'm learning something new in technology. However, I do maintain accounts on `Stack Overflow, and other technical forums like dev.to and Medium`. I've answered some questions on Stack Overflow and Quora, which has helped me earn recognition points on these websites. Additionally, `I have written several articles on Medium.`

## Highly Visible Technical Content

I have authored articles on the Medium platform covering a range of topics, from `setting up a dual-boot system to installing Python libraries`. The motivation for each article stems from challenges I encountered while performing these tasks on my own computer. Beyond my Medium articles, I have `composed futuristic technical blogs for IEEE competitions`, which have earned me first and second prizes. Many ideas exist in my mind, which I sometimes find difficult to express in words. Therefore, I am `actively working on documenting` these thoughts more effectively.

## Leadership and Influence

Leading our mini-project and main project was a transformative experience that `revealed the true leader within me`. I believe a genuine leader embodies expertise and knowledge, provides ethical guidance, and extends help to others. To live up to these ideals, I have taken the following steps:

> Expertise and Knowledge: I strive to master as many technologies as possible in a limited timeframe. To share this knowledge with my team, I document what I learn and disseminate it through Google Meets or regular calls, ensuring everyone is on the same page and equipped with the latest insights.

> Ethical Guidance: My leadership philosophy is centered on authenticity. I advocate for showcasing our genuine efforts rather than resorting to plagiarism. This approach might mean our work appears modest in quantity and quality, but it's crucial for me to underpromise and overdeliver. When my team members look to me for encouragement, I focus on setting realistic expectations and then exceeding them.

> Helping Others: According to my teammates and classmates, I am known for my willingness to adjust my personal schedule to assist others in need. My motivation is not the pursuit of gratitude but the joy and satisfaction derived from seeing others succeed. This sense of shared achievement serves as a powerful source of internal motivation for me.

## As a Top 20 Member

Programming is fundamental in the fields of Computer Science and Information Technology. `To challenge and test my programming proficiency, especially with Python, I have joined the Top20 Coders competition.` Qualifying for Top20 Coders would not only serve as a significant achievement but also `act as a credible validation of my skills`. Such a distinction would be a `compelling asset in job interviews`, showcasing my abilities to potential employers and `setting me apart in the competitive job market.`

## Career Plan

Currently, I am on the lookout for job opportunities because I want to gain firsthand experience in the professional work environment. Understanding the dynamics of teamwork, leadership, and project management in a real-world setting is crucial for me at this stage. In the future, however, I am keen on exploring entrepreneurship. If conditions align favorably, I plan to leverage my experiences and insights gained from the workforce to embark on an entrepreneurial venture.
