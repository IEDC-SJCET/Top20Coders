### Leadership and Influence

While I may not consider myself a perfect leader, I believe in stepping up when needed and fulfilling the responsibilities that come with leadership. If entrusted with leading a team, I embrace it as my duty to guide, delegate, analyze, correct, and make decisions collaboratively. For instance, during group projects, I often take the initiative to organize tasks, facilitate discussions, and ensure everyone's voice is heard. Additionally, I actively seek resolutions to conflicts and problems within the team, fostering a positive and productive environment. Though I'm still growing as a leader, I am committed to continually improving and making a meaningful impact in my domain.

### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

Indian engineering education, including institutions like SJCET Palai, often leans heavily towards theoretical learning rather than practical application. The curriculum tends to be outdated, focusing on traditional methods and technologies rather than keeping pace with industry demands. To improve, there needs to be a shift towards a more practical-oriented approach, ensuring students are equipped with the skills and knowledge required in the real world.

Firstly, updating the syllabus regularly, perhaps every one or two years, is crucial. It should incorporate the latest advancements in technology and industry trends. Additionally, providing hands-on experience from the first year itself through small tasks, coding competitions, and projects would greatly benefit students. For instance, CS students could be encouraged to develop simple apps or websites right from the beginning, gradually building their skills and confidence.

Institutions should also focus on fostering a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. Encouraging students to think creatively, solve real-world problems, and collaborate on projects can prepare them better for the dynamic nature of the industry.

Moreover, partnerships with industry players for internships, guest lectures, and workshops can provide valuable insights and exposure to the current industry practices.

As a third-year student, I've personally experienced the challenges of transitioning from theoretical knowledge to practical application. Therefore, starting practical learning from the foundational years would undoubtedly enhance the overall learning experience and better prepare students for their future careers.
