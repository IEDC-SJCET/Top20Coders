### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

Indian engineering education has strengths in producing a large number of graduates annually but faces challenges such as outdated curricula, inadequate infrastructure, and limited industry collaboration. Improvement areas include updating curricula, enhancing faculty quality, improving infrastructure, fostering industry partnerships, and promoting research and innovation.
