### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

Indian engineering education has long been renowned for its rigorous academic curriculum and emphasis on technical proficiency. With a rich history dating back to the establishment of prestigious institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Indian engineering education has produced a plethora of skilled professionals who have made significant contributions to various industries globally. However in my opinion the curriculum needs to be constantly updated as fields like computer science are rapidly evolving and the curriulum should always stay on par with the industry requirements.
