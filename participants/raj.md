### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

The Indian Engineering Education System is not the perfect or best example of A system of education, as the concept of learning code byheart instead of learning what it does,
and having to write it on paper instead on implementing on a computer to see in real time how their code works is one of the biggest issues facing the system when it comes to the computer field.
Giving more importance to practical learning and not theoretical learning can greatly improve how the system can help guide the students to a better future and learn more and learn better.
SJCET Palai has been a great institution for learning and providing oppurtunities to learn throgh workshops from well reputed and talented and inspirational people or compete in competitions nationwide.
It provides a great Launch pad for stdents to hopefully progress and have wonderful career oppurtunities.
