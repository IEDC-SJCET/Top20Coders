## About Me

I'm Aneeta Jose from Palai. I'm an engineering student from SJCET specialized in AI and Data Science. Though I do not have any real life working experience, I've had a lot of exposure to the software field. I'm hoping to apply my knowledge into practice. My goal is to build a successful career as an AI Engineer. Moving forward in my career I hope to expand my experience across different industries. I'm a fast learner and a good teammate.

### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

I have a conflicting opinion about Indian Engineering Education. Though India was able to produce many successful engineers and entrepenuers, the education system needs to be more practical than theoretical. I perceive a significant gap in the ratio of successful engineers to those who have not achieved success, perhaps around 1:9. 

Talking about SJCET, the management should encourage real-life project opportunities for students than tying them down in the name of academics.
