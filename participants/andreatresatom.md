I am applying because I want to learn, upskill ,and connect .
I am interested in cyber security , understanding how computers work can help me a lot with that , as a bonus .also help build my problem solving skills and just expand my skillset .


### Career Plan

I dont have a set plan , I am interested in exploring and finding one that fits me .Get this degree, and on the way, certifications , do projects all that and I'd take a job if it finds me . 
Being part of a startup seems exciting , I am not passing on that opportunity.

### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

It could be better , there are a lot of things that needs to change . For example , the grading system that favours memorization is a disadvantage to some. An improvement could be encouraging more projects ,giving more time for other learning activities and less emphasis on grades.
