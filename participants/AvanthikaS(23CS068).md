### History of Community Engagement

As a first year CS student, my journey into the coding field has been a whirlwind of discoveries and growth.

My journey began with the SmartIndia Hackathon held in September 2023. I have also participated in other events like TinkerHub WebQuest and IEEE Xtremists Coding Competition. Besides that, I have been an active member of the GTech Mulearn Learning Fest 2023 on Discord. While I don’t have any great successes to share, the events I’ve participated in so far and every interaction has been an opportunity to learn, innovate and inspire.

### As a Top 20 Member

I am applying for the Top 20 competition because it represents an unparalleled opportunity to challenge myself, showcase my coding abilities, and connect with like-minded individuals in the field. As a first-year computer science student, participating in this prestigious event aligns directly with my career aspirations. It allows me to put my theoretical knowledge into practice, refine my problem-solving skills, and gain invaluable hands-on experience. Moreover, being recognized as one of the Top 20 coders would significantly elevate my professional profile, opening doors to internships, job opportunities, and networking connections that could accelerate my career path. This competition serves as a catalyst for personal and professional growth, providing a platform to demonstrate my passion for coding and establish myself as another worthy contributor to the tech industry.

### Career Plan

My future career plans revolve around becoming a data scientist, a role that combines my passion for data analysis, programming, and problem-solving. To achieve this goal, I intend to pursue higher education, possibly obtaining a master's degree in data science or a related field to deepen my understanding of statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization techniques. Currently, I plan to gain practical experience through internships, research projects, and online courses to strengthen my skills and build a strong portfolio. Ultimately, I aspire to work in a dynamic and innovative environment where I can apply my expertise in data science to tackle complex challenges, drive insights, and make a meaningful impact.

### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

Indian engineering education holds immense potential but faces various challenges. While they often provide a strong theoretical foundation, there's a need to bridge the gap between academia and industry by focusing more on practical, hands-on learning experiences. Updating the curriculum to reflect current industry demands, fostering a culture of innovation and research and strengthening industry-academia partnerships are essential steps. The current curriculum is very old, which is something I can learn very quickly as a first year student. It teaches all students C programming from S2, which are taken further in the years to come. But in my opinion, C is an outdated language, replaced by newer languages ​​like Python. So everyone should have been taught that instead of C. Prioritizing these changes, Indian engineering education can better prepare students for the evolving demands of the global job market.
Known for its commitment to academic excellence and holistic development, SJCET Palai is highly regarded in the field of engineering education. Our college has a strong faculty base, modern infrastructure and all other facilities. Overall, SJCET Palai seems to be a prestigious institution dedicated to nurturing talent, and producing skilled engineers who are ready to make a significant contribution to society and industry. Perhaps it's time for the college to invest less in infrastructure and more in fostering a vibrant cultural scene. After all, a little bit of spice could go a long way in adding flavor to those otherwise bland academic routines.
